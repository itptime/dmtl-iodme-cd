This code and data are an implementation of paper "Deep Multitask Learning for
Individuals Origin-Destination Matrices Estimation from Census Data".

The data are composed of X and Y datasets, X the inputs and Y the outputs. They are
located in the data folder. The data are under proprietary licence and cannot be shared.

The code is at the root of this folder, it is composed of:

- Global results
    1. multitask.py and singletask.py
    2. show_results.py
- One versus others results
    1. ovo_multitask.py and ovo_singletask.py
    2. show_ovo_results.py

Execute step 1 and then step 2.
